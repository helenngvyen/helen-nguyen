            <p class="paragraph short-p">As a three-month academic project, <strong>proxi</strong> is a mobile recipe
                app designed for selective
                eaters to find recipes catering to their dietary needs while promoting food exploration.

            <h3 class="h3-projects">THE PROCESS</h3>

            <h3 class="h3-sub">content & needs</h3>
            <p class="paragraph1 short-p">In the early stages of the process, we began by investigating the issues our
                targeted audience encountered while searching for new recipes. I found that selective eaters potentially
                had lower qualities of life due to food-related stress, as they were unable to search for and adapt to
                their dietary restrictions.</p>

            <p class="paragraph1 short-p">Our other findings also found that, overall, these people had a hard time
                modifying recipes as it requires additional knowledge on the different substitutions and options
                available to them that would impact their overall health.
                This is important because not every meal plan is suitable for each person, but by substituting
                individual ingredients, it allows them to eat familiar foods while maintaining their dietary goals.</p>

            <h3 class="h3-sub">findings</h3>
            <p class="paragraph1 short-p">Our team analyzed the common challenges that arose from the goals of our
                target audience, where we began proposing viable design opportunities that would enhance the users’
                experience.</p>

            <div class="project1-container">
                <figure>

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <h3 class="h3-sub">User Persona</h3>
            <p class="paragraph1 short-p">We created two user personas that were realistic and reliable representations
                of our potential target audience. These representations were based on qualitive and quantative user
                research. By understanding who we are designing for, it allows us to recognize the expectations,
                concerns, and motications of the users.</p>

            <div class="project2-container">

                <p class="paragraph1 short-p">Mia is our first user persona, a full-time student who recently
                    transitioned to a vegetarian diet but currently struggling in finding meals that help her maintain
                    her dietary needs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project2-container">

                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p class="paragraph1 short-p">Taylor is our user persona, a full time worker who was recently diagnosed
                    with celiac disease. Due to this, she had to transition to a gluten-free diet and it's been
                    difficult due to the lack of knowledge she currently has about substitutable ingredients.</p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="h3-sub">the framework</h3>
            <p class="paragraph1 short-p">Through preliminary research of academic sources and user interviews, we began
                creating our sitemap, highlighting the features we would include in our design.</p>

            <div class="project1-container">
                <figure>
                    <img class="gallery-cover" src="img/proxi-sitemap.png" alt="CRH Cover Image">

                </figure>
            </div>


            <h3 class="h3-sub">objectives</h3>
            <p class="paragraph1 short-p">Then we focused on what our main objectives would be for this interface.</p>

            <div class="short-p">
                <ul>1. How can we organize <strong>large amounts of information</strong> into consumable portions? For
                    instance, would we sort by popular recipes? or have distinctive categories?
                </ul>
                <ul>2. How in depth will each page be? Will be have full-pages and/or pop-ups based on
                    <strong>infornmation immediately needed?</strong> </ul>
                <ul>3. And finally, how can we <strong>balance</strong> the above two criteria for the user to explore
                    new interests, while also finding specfiic and accurate information that is quickly accessible and
                    highly specific?
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3 class="h3-sub">solution</h3>
            <p class="paragraph1 short-p">We created medium-fidelity mockups and began comparing the different designs
                we had. By comparing and constrasting with reasonable explanation and reasoning, we were able to choose
                a design to go forward with.</p>

            <div class="project2-container">
                <figure>
                    <img class="gallery-cover" src="img/proxi-option1.png" alt="proxi Cover Image">

                </figure>
            </div>


            <h3 class="h3-sub">features</h3>

            <p class="paragraph1 short-p"><strong>Ingredient Substitutions:</strong> Allows the user to substitute
                ingredients directly on the recipe or in the search feature. The pop-up feature allows the user to
                selective view additional information without being overwhelmed. They can further view the subsitute
                ingredient by viewing it on the full ingredients page if needed. </p>

            <p class="paragraph1 short-p"><strong>Search Recipe Catalog:</strong> The recipe filtering system enables
                the possibility of sorting searches by preparation time, cuisine, and avoided ingredients. The flexible
                of this feature allows the user the option of more refined searches or the ability to search freely if
                desired.</p>

            <p class="paragraph1 short-p"><strong>Personalized Preferences:</strong> The creation of an account allows
                the user to define their deitary preferences, intolerances, and allergies to find recipe suggestions
                that cater to their dietary restrictions and nutritional needs. Preferences can be modiled and adjusted
                when needed under the profile tab.</p>

            <p class="paragraph1 short-p">I was responsible for designing the home page, full recipe page, ingredient
                page, and filtered search results. </p>

            <div class="project1-container">

                </figure>
            </div>

            <h3 class="h3-sub">usability testing</h3>
            <p class="paragraph1 short-p">For our user interviews, we searched for participants in our targeted
                demographic, young adults with dietary restrictions with a desire to cook. These were the steps we
                guided our user in:</p>

            <li>Create an account</li>
            <li>Search for a recipe</li>
            <li>Use the filter search catalog</li>
            <li>Find alternative ingredients</li>
            <li>Bookmark a recipe</li>
            <li>View profile and edit dietary choices</li>

            <div class="project1-container">
                <figure>
                    <img class="gallery-cover" src="img/proxi-process.png" alt="proxi">
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph1 short-p">We were all tasked in performing a user interview for each participant we
                recruited. I was able to successfully interview Kenny through the testing process over a zoom call.</p>

            <p class="paragraph1 short-p">Conducting a user interview online is definitely more challenging than an
                in-person call, as there were gaps in communication where I needed to provide more guidance to explain
                certain features. It was difficult to assess and troubleshoot the prototype error as it was difficult to
                see the user's perspective.</p>

            <p class="paragraph1 short-p">We collectively began analysing our findings from our particpants and
                discovered a few common usability issues and minor styling concerns. As a team, we identified solutions
                that would consider the goals of our end user.</p>

                </figure>
            </div>

            <h3 class="h3-sub">reflection</h3>
            <p class="paragraph1 short-p">Throughout the duration of the project, our team was able to develop a functional recipe searching mobile application. This created a strong foundation of skills, where it can be applied to future projects.</p>

            <p class="paragraph1 short-p">This experience has given me many opportunity in growth, including using prototyping tools like UXPin, to explore how interaction works in the experience of a mobile design application. This project centred heavily on user-experience, where the heavy significance of prioritizing user needs and goals ultimately allows for the design of an optimal interface. Considering the user needs and goals, as well as maintaining the design principles allowed us to successfully complete this project.</p>
