                <p class= "paragraph short-p">As a three-month academic project, CRH Studios is a fictional company made fully intent on building an e-commerce portal for the business. The objective of this project was for students to gain a firm understanding of the potential user goals and flows within an online service and be able to code and design a fully functional, front-end responsive website. My team and I took on the roles of UX designers to create a brand identity for a small studio selling handcrafted ceramic goods with the aim of developing a front-end website that is both engaging and easy to navigate for potential users.

                    <h3 class="h3-sub">content & needs</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph1 short-p">In the early stages of the process, we conducted comparative research across multiple ecommerce sites to determine the required functionality, client goals, and the typical consumer flow. To summarize our findings, we found that the most important points would include clear pathing, price transparency and credibility, and an overall user-friendly experience that is seamless.</p>

                    <h3 class="h3-sub">design considerations</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph1 short-p">Collaborating in Figma, we developed medium-fidelity wireframes to create a general layout before moving forward to higher fidelity mockups consisting of color schemes, textual content and images. This was a long iteration process, as we went through multiple feedback sessions, while keeping in mind the user and their needs. </p>

                    <h3 class="h3-sub">challenges</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph1 short-p">My main tasks included developing a subset of HTML/CSS pages for the home page, product layout, and cart. While my main skills were to develop the initial designs of many of the pages, I initially had a harder time coding these pages, as we had to make sure as a team, we were cohesively working together and making the design and coding language cohesive. One of the biggest challenges I came across was the encounter of bugs, but with the help of Chrome’s developer tools and Stack Overflow, I have been able to proceed through trial and error.</p>

                    <h3 class="h3-sub">finale</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph1 short-p">
                        Despite the challenges, I have greatly developed and improved my technical and design skills. Moving forward, I hope to push myself further to step out of my comfort zone and apply this experience to a variety of projects. Below are some screenshots of the final pages.
